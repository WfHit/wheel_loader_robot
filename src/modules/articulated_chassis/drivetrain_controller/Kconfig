	---help---
		Enable closed-loop drivetrain controller for articulated wheel loader.

		This module provides individual wheel speed control using:
		- PID control with quadrature encoder feedback
		- DRV8701 H-bridge motor driver interface
		- Low-pass filtering for noise reduction
		- Safety monitoring and emergency stop
		- Multi-instance support for front/rear axles
		- Configurable control parameters via PX4 parameter system

		The controller accepts speed setpoints and maintains precise wheel
		velocity control for traction optimization and stable operation
		in mining environments.
