	  Enable the Navigation Lamp Controller module, which receives lamp state commands
	  and outputs trigger pulses to change the lamp state sequentially.

	  Note: This module requires BOARD_HAS_STATUS_LAMP_TRIGGER to be defined
	  in the board configuration. On unsupported boards, the module will start
	  but GPIO operations will be disabled.
