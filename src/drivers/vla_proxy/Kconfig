	  Enable support for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Proxy driver.

	  This driver provides communication with VLA models via UART interface,
	  allowing autonomous wheel loader bucket control with 6DOF trajectory
	  commands. The driver sends robot status to the VLA model and receives
	  trajectory setpoints for bucket positioning.
