        description:
          short: Channel 0 direction reverse
          long: |
            Reverse the direction signal for channel 0.
            Set to 1 to invert the direction GPIO signal (0=forward becomes 1=forward).

        description:
          short: Channel 0 forward limit sensor function
          long: |
            Limit sensor function ID that will stop channel 0 when moving forward.
            Set to 255 to disable limit checking for channel 0 forward direction.
